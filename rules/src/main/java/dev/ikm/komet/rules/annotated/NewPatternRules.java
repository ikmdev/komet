/**
 * Rules relater to pattern-related statements

 * To simplify the conditions of the rules, this ruleset employs custom field declarations through
 * the use of the {@link FieldDeclaration} annotation.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Custom field declarations provide an additional abstraction layer for the domain classes and allow
 * for changing the conditions easily should the domain classes change. And, as a side benefit,
 * we no longer need to include now unnecessary imports via the
 * {@link org.evrete.api.Knowledge#addImport(Class)} method.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Custom fields are better placed in a common parent class so they could be reused
 * by multiple rulesets.

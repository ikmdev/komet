/**
 * The {@code DraggableWithImage} interface defines a contract for draggable entities that provide
 * a visual representation (image) during drag-and-drop operations.
 * <p>
 * Implementing this interface allows an object to supply an image that visually represents it
 * when it is being dragged. Additionally, it provides an offset value to correctly position
 * the drag image relative to the cursor.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * <strong>Usage Example:</strong>
 * <pre>{@code
 * public class DraggableItem implements DraggableWithImage {
 *
 *     private Image dragImage;
 *     private double dragOffsetX;
 *
 *     public DraggableItem() {
 *         // Initialize dragImage and dragOffsetX as needed
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public Image getDragImage() {
 *         return this.dragImage;
 *     }
 *
 *     @Override
 *     public double getDragViewOffsetX() {
 *         return this.dragOffsetX;
 *     }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface is particularly useful in GUI applications where visual feedback during
 * drag-and-drop enhances user experience. By providing a custom image and offset, developers
 * can ensure that the drag operation is intuitive and visually consistent.
 * </p>

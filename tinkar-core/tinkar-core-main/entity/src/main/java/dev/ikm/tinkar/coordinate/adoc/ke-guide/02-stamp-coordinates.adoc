= STAMP Coordinates

== Overview

STAMP coordinates answer: *"When am I looking, and from which branch?"*

STAMP = **S**tatus + **T**ime + **A**uthor + **M**odule + **P**ath

Every piece of content carries STAMP metadata. STAMP coordinates tell the system which versions to show you.

== The Five Components

=== Status: Active vs. Inactive

* *Active* - Current, should be displayed
* *Inactive* - Retired, deprecated, deleted

**When to use:**

* Active only → End users, clinical systems (most common)
* Both → Authoring, QA, historical analysis
* Inactive only → Finding retired concepts (rare)

=== Time: When Are You Looking?

* *Latest* - Current state (95% of use cases)
* *Specific Date* - Historical view for analysis or troubleshooting

**Example:** Set time to "2 weeks ago" to see what content looked like then, compare with today to find changes.

=== Author: Who Made Changes?

Tracks who created or modified content (tracked but not filtered):

* For audit trails and accountability
* For quality reviews
* For change attribution

**Note:** Author is informational—you typically don't filter by it.

=== Module: Organizational Grouping

Modules group content by ownership:

* SNOMED CT Core
* US Extension
* Local Hospital Extension

**Options:**

* Include specific modules only
* Exclude specific modules
* Prioritize modules (when conflicts exist)

=== Path: Development Branches

Paths represent parallel development lines:

* *Production* - Released content
* *Development* - Work in progress
* *Staging* - Testing before release
* *Sandbox* - Experiments

**Key Point:** Content is visible on a path if created there OR inherited from parent path before branching.

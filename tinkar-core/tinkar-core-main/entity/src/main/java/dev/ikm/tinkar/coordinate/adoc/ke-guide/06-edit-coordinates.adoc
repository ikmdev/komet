= Edit Coordinates

== Overview

Edit coordinates answer: *"Who am I, and where does my work go?"*

They control authoring attribution and content organization.

== The Five Components

=== 1. Author for Changes

Your identity: Individual name, role, team, or system

**Why:** Accountability, quality tracking, audit trails

=== 2. Default Module

Where new content is created:

* Core module
* National extension
* Local extension

**Note:** Applies to new content only. Existing content stays in original module.

=== 3. Destination Module

Where content moves during modularization (reorganizing between modules)

=== 4. Default Path

Which branch to write to:

* Development - Active authoring
* Staging - Testing
* Production - Released (usually read-only)

=== 5. Promotion Path

Target branch for promoting content (Development → Staging → Production)

== The Three Workflows

=== 1. Developing

Creating or modifying content:

* New concepts → Default module, development path
* Existing concepts → Original module preserved, new version on development path

=== 2. Modularizing

Moving content between modules:

* Selected concepts → Destination module
* Creates new versions with module change

=== 3. Promoting

Moving content between paths:

* Copies from source path to promotion path
* Typical: Development → Staging → Production

== Standard Development Pipeline

Development Path → Staging Path → Production Path

* *Development*: Author and refine
* *Staging*: QA and validation
* *Production*: Release to end users

== Best Practices

* Verify edit coordinate before authoring
* Use project modules for temporary work
* Never author directly on Production
* Always promote through staging for QA

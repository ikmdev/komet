= Best Practices

== Top 10 Coordinate Practices

=== 1. Know Your Role

Set coordinates appropriate for your role:

* Editor: Development path, stated view
* QA: Staging path, inferred view
* End User: Production path, active only

=== 2. Verify Before Authoring

At session start, confirm:

* Author: Your identity
* Module: Correct project module
* Path: Development (NOT production!)

=== 3. Default to Active Only for End Users

Clinical and business users should see active content only. Both active/inactive is for authors and QA.

=== 4. Work on Development, Release from Production

Never author directly on Production. Always: Development → Staging → Production.

=== 5. Use Cascading for Multilingual

Always provide fallback languages:

* Primary language
* Fallback language (usually English)
* Last resort: Any language

=== 6. Author with Stated, Browse with Inferred

* Author: Stated hierarchy (see what you're modeling)
* Validate: Inferred hierarchy (see classification results)
* End Users: Inferred hierarchy (complete view)

=== 7. Match Description Types to Audience

* Clinicians: Preferred Terms
* Patients: Synonyms or Preferred Terms
* Technical Staff: Fully Qualified Names
* Help Systems: Definitions

=== 8. Classify Regularly During Development

Don't wait weeks between classifications. Classify daily during active development to catch issues early.

=== 9. Keep Coordinates Consistent During Work Sessions

Don't constantly switch coordinates. Set them at session start and keep them stable for coherent work.

=== 10. Share Coordinate Context When Collaborating

When discussing content with teammates, specify which coordinates you're using. "I don't see that!" often means different coordinates.

== Common Pitfalls to Avoid

*Pitfall 1: Forgetting You're on Development Path*

Users can't see your work because you're viewing Development, they're viewing Production.

**Solution:** Be aware of your path. Promote when ready.

*Pitfall 2: Using Stated Hierarchy for End Users*

Stated is sparse and incomplete for browsing.

**Solution:** End users need inferred hierarchy.

*Pitfall 3: Showing Inactive Concepts to End Users*

Confuses users with retired content.

**Solution:** Active only for clinical interfaces.

*Pitfall 4: Not Cascading Languages*

Blank descriptions when translation missing.

**Solution:** Always use fallback languages.

*Pitfall 5: Authoring on Production*

Untested content reaches users immediately.

**Solution:** Author on Development only.

== Quick Checklist

*Before Authoring:*

- [ ] Author identity correct?
- [ ] Default module correct?
- [ ] Default path = Development?
- [ ] Status = Both (to avoid duplicating retired concepts)?

*Before Promoting to Production:*

- [ ] Classification complete?
- [ ] QA review passed?
- [ ] Stakeholder approval?
- [ ] Release notes prepared?

*For End User Interfaces:*

- [ ] Status = Active only?
- [ ] Path = Production?
- [ ] Language appropriate?
- [ ] Navigation = Inferred hierarchy?

== Summary

Coordinates are powerful filters that control what you see and how you interact with terminology. Use them skillfully:

* Set them appropriately for your role
* Keep them consistent during work
* Verify before critical operations
* Understand common patterns
* Avoid common pitfalls

Master coordinates, and you'll be a more effective knowledge engineer.

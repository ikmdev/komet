= Logic Coordinates

== Overview

Logic coordinates answer: *"Should I see stated or inferred relationships?"*

They control whether you see relationships as authored (stated) or as computed by the classifier (inferred).

== Stated vs. Inferred

=== Stated Relationships

*What:* Relationships you explicitly authored

*Characteristics:*

* Direct author control
* Sparse (only necessary relationships)
* What you see in editing tools

**Example:** "Bacterial pneumonia IS-A Pneumonia" (what you wrote)

=== Inferred Relationships

*What:* Relationships computed by the classifier

*Characteristics:*

* Automatically generated
* Complete (all logical implications)
* What you want for browsing

**Example:** Classifier adds: "Bacterial pneumonia IS-A Lung disease" and "Bacterial pneumonia IS-A Infectious disease" (computed from logic)

*Key Rule:* **Author with stated, browse with inferred.**

== Classification

Classification is the process where a reasoning engine:

1. Reads your stated definitions
2. Computes logical implications
3. Generates inferred relationships

**Why it matters:**

* Ensures logical consistency
* Finds relationships you didn't state explicitly
* Helps catch modeling errors (concepts landing in wrong places)

**Workflow:**

1. Author content (stated view)
2. Run classification
3. Review results (inferred view)
4. Refine if needed

== Decision Guide

*Use Stated When:*

* Creating/editing concepts
* Understanding what was explicitly modeled
* Debugging classification issues

*Use Inferred When:*

* Browsing for end users
* Searching for concepts
* Validating classification results
* Determining complete logical relationships

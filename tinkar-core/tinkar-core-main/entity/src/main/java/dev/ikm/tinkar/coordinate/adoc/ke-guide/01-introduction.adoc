= Understanding Coordinates

== What Are Coordinates?

A **coordinate** is a set of specifications that tells the knowledge system what content to show you and how to display it. Think of coordinates like viewing filters on a website:

* Change language: English to Spanish
* Filter by date: Show content from last month
* Filter by status: Show active items only
* Sort results: Alphabetical or by relevance

IKE coordinates work the same way—they control your view of terminology content.

== Why Coordinates Matter

Knowledge engineers face these challenges daily:

*Time Problem:* Which version of "Pneumonia" should you see—today's, last month's, or from last year?

*Language Problem:* Should "Diabetes mellitus" display in English or Spanish? Preferred term or fully qualified name?

*Hierarchy Problem:* Should you see the hierarchy as authors wrote it (stated) or as the classifier computed it (inferred)?

*Authoring Problem:* When you create new concepts, who is recorded as the author, and which module do they go into?

**Coordinates solve all these problems** by explicitly specifying your viewing context.

== About IKE and TINKAR

The *IKE Coordinate System* is the open-source framework for managing complex knowledge at scale, based on the HL7 Terminology Knowledge Architecture (TINKAR) specification.

* *TINKAR* = Formal HL7 specification and technical foundation
* *IKE* = Open-source ecosystem and community implementation

Throughout this guide, we refer to the *IKE Coordinate System* conceptually, while technical artifacts may reference "TINKAR" for backward compatibility.

== The Five Coordinate Types

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Coordinate |What It Controls

|*STAMP*
|**When** you're looking (time, status, modules, development paths)

|*Language*
|**What language** and description types to display

|*Logic*
|**How** concepts are classified (stated vs. inferred relationships)

|*Navigation*
|**Which hierarchies** to browse and how to sort them

|*Edit*
|**Who you are** and where your authoring work goes
|===

== How Coordinates Work Together

All five coordinate types combine to create a complete "view" of your knowledge base.

*Example Clinical Browse Configuration:*

* STAMP: Active only, Latest, Production path
* Language: US English preferred terms
* Logic: Inferred relationships
* Navigation: Inferred hierarchy, alphabetical sorting
* Edit: Not applicable (read-only)

**Result:** Clinicians see complete, current, active concepts with readable names in a logical hierarchy.

*Example Content Authoring Configuration:*

* STAMP: Both active/inactive, Latest, Development path
* Language: US English, fully qualified names
* Logic: Stated relationships (while authoring)
* Navigation: Stated hierarchy
* Edit: Your name, Local Extension module, Development path

**Result:** You see everything needed for authoring, with clear attribution and proper content organization.

== Key Benefits

*Consistency:* Every operation uses the same coordinate—no mixed views.

*Reproducibility:* Same coordinates = same results. Critical for collaboration.

*Transparency:* Coordinates make assumptions explicit—you know exactly what you're viewing.

*Flexibility:* Change perspective instantly by changing coordinates.

== When You Interact with Coordinates

You interact with coordinates during:

* *Browsing/Searching* - Coordinates determine what you can see
* *Quality Assurance* - Compare versions, check translations, validate hierarchies
* *Content Authoring* - Coordinates track you as author and organize your work
* *Release Management* - Verify content before promoting to production

== What's Next

The following sections explain each coordinate type:

* STAMP - Time, status, and versioning
* Language - Multilingual descriptions
* Logic - Classification and reasoning
* Navigation - Hierarchies and browsing
* Edit - Authoring and workflows

Then we'll cover practical scenarios and best practices.

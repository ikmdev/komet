= Navigation Coordinates

== Overview

Navigation coordinates answer: *"How do I browse hierarchies?"*

They control which hierarchies to display, whether to show inactive concepts, and how to sort children.

== The Three Components

=== 1. Navigation Patterns

Which hierarchy to use:

* *Inferred IS-A* - Complete logical hierarchy (most common)
* *Stated IS-A* - Authored relationships only
* *Custom* - Organization-specific (part-of, location-of, etc.)

=== 2. Vertex States

Which concepts to include:

* *Active only* - Current concepts (most common)
* *Both* - Active and inactive (for authoring, QA)
* *Inactive only* - Retired concepts (rare)

=== 3. Sorting

How to order children:

* *Alphabetical* - Easy to find (most common)
* *Natural order* - Unsorted, preserves creation order
* *Custom* - Domain-specific (by frequency, severity, etc.)

== Stated vs. Inferred Hierarchies

*Stated:* Sparse, shows only what you authored

* Use for: Authoring, understanding modeling

*Inferred:* Complete, shows all logical relationships

* Use for: Browsing, searching, end users

== Common Configurations

[cols="1,2"]

|Use Case |Navigation Settings

|*End user browsing*
|Inferred IS-A, Active only, Alphabetical

|*Content authoring*
|Stated IS-A, Both active/inactive, Natural order

|*QA review*
|Inferred IS-A, Both, Alphabetical

|*Custom workflow*
|Custom pattern, Active only, Custom sort

== Decision Guide

*Pattern:*

* Inferred IS-A → General browsing, searching
* Stated IS-A → Authoring, debugging
* Custom → Specialized workflows

*Vertex States:*

* Active only → End users
* Both → Authoring, QA

*Sorting:*

* Alphabetical → General use
* Natural order → Development
* Custom → Specialized workflows

== Scenario 1: Clinical Terminology Browser

*Context:* Hospital terminology browser for clinicians

*Requirements:* Active concepts, US English, current content, production-quality

*Coordinate Configuration:*

* STAMP: Active only, Latest, Production
* Language: US English preferred terms
* Logic: Inferred relationships
* Navigation: Inferred IS-A, Active only, Alphabetical
* Edit: Not applicable (read-only)

*Result:* Clinicians see complete, current, active concepts with readable names.

== Scenario 2: Content Author Workstation

*Context:* Knowledge engineer creating local hospital extension concepts

*Requirements:* See all content, work on development, validate with classification

*Authoring Configuration:*

* STAMP: Both active/inactive, Latest, Development
* Language: English, fully qualified names
* Logic: Stated relationships
* Navigation: Stated IS-A, Both, Natural order
* Edit: Author name, Local Extension module, Development path

*Validation Configuration (after classification):*

* Logic: Inferred relationships
* Navigation: Inferred IS-A, Alphabetical

*Workflow:*

1. Author with stated view
2. Run classification
3. Switch to inferred view to validate
4. Refine if needed
5. Promote to Staging when ready

== Scenario 3: Multilingual Patient Portal

*Context:* Patient-facing health portal serving English and Spanish speakers

*Requirements:* Prefer Spanish, fallback to English, patient-friendly terms

*Coordinate Configuration:*

* STAMP: Active only, Latest, Production

*Content Authoring:*

* Both active/inactive, Latest, Development
* Stated (authoring) → Inferred (validation)
* Author identity, Extension module

*QA Review:*

* Both active/inactive, Latest, Staging
* Inferred hierarchy

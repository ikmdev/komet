= Language Coordinates

== Overview

Language coordinates answer: *"What language and description type do I want?"*

A single concept can have many descriptions (multiple languages, types, dialects). Language coordinates specify your preferences.

== The Four Components

=== 1. Language

Natural language: English, Spanish, French, etc.

=== 2. Description Types

* *Preferred Term* - Main name ("Pneumonia")
* *Fully Qualified Name* - With disambiguation ("Pneumonia (disorder)")
* *Synonym* - Alternative name ("Lung infection")
* *Definition* - Full explanation

=== 3. Dialect Preferences

Regional variants:

* US English vs. GB English ("Color" vs. "Colour")
* Mexican Spanish vs. Spain Spanish

=== 4. Module Preferences

When multiple descriptions exist, which source wins (Local > National > Core).

== Cascading Languages

Specify fallback order:

1. Spanish (primary)
2. English (fallback)
3. Any language (last resort)

**Why:** Translation gaps are common. Fallback ensures users always see something.

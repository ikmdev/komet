--
A comprehensive guide to understanding and using the IKE Coordinate System (Integrated Knowledge Ecosystem) for managing temporal, versioned knowledge graphs. This guide covers all five coordinate types (STAMP, Language, Logic, Navigation, and Edit) and shows how to configure them for different use cases.

_Note: This coordinate system was originally published as part of the HL7 Terminology Knowledge Architecture (TINKAR) ballot. While TINKAR remains the historical and technical foundation, the open-source community now refers to this collaborative framework as the Integrated Knowledge Ecosystem (IKE)._

== Document Overview

This Getting Started Guide provides Java developers and users with practical knowledge of the IKE Coordinate System. The guide is organized into the following sections:

* *Introduction* - What coordinates are and why they matter
* *STAMP Coordinates* - Temporal versioning and provenance
* *Language Coordinates* - Multilingual description management
* *Logic Coordinates* - Description logic and reasoning
* *Navigation Coordinates* - Graph traversal and hierarchies
* *Edit Coordinates* - Change attribution and authoring
* *View Coordinates* - Unified coordinate access
* *Practical Examples* - Real-world configuration scenarios
* *Best Practices* - Tips for effective coordinate usage

== Target Audience

This guide is designed for:

* *Java Developers* building applications on the IKE platform
* *Knowledge Engineers* configuring terminology systems
* *System Administrators* managing knowledge bases
* *Integration Specialists* connecting IKE to other systems

== Prerequisites

To use this guide effectively, you should have:

* Basic Java programming knowledge
* Understanding of concepts like immutability and threading
* Familiarity with terminology and knowledge representation (helpful but not required)

== How to Use This Guide

Each section can be read independently, but we recommend reading them in order for a complete understanding:

1. Start with the *Introduction* to understand the overall architecture
2. Read each coordinate type section based on your needs
3. Review the *Practical Examples* for real-world scenarios
4. Consult the *Best Practices* when implementing

TIP: Code examples are provided throughout. You can copy and adapt them for your own use.

== Getting Help

If you need assistance:

* Review the JavaDoc in the `dev.ikm.tinkar.coordinate` package
* Check the code examples in each section
* Consult the API reference for detailed method signatures
* Reach out to the IKE community for support

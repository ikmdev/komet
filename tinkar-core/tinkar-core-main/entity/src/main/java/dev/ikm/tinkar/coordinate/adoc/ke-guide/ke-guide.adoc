[abstract]
--
A practical guide for knowledge engineers and business analysts to understand the IKE Coordinate System (Integrated Knowledge Ecosystem). Learn how coordinates control what you see when browsing, searching, and editing knowledge.

_Note: This coordinate system is based on the HL7 Terminology Knowledge Architecture (TINKAR) specification. Technical references use "Tinkar" in code for backward compatibility._

== About This Guide

*For:* Knowledge Engineers, Business Analysts, Content Managers, Clinical Informaticists

*You'll Learn:*

* What coordinates are and why they matter
* The five coordinate types and when to use each
* How to configure coordinates for common tasks
* Best practices for terminology work

*You Will NOT Find:* Code examples, programming syntax, or API documentation (see the Developer's Guide for those)

== The Five Coordinate Types

[cols="1,2,2"]
|===
|Type |Controls |Your Question

|*STAMP*
|Time, status, modules, paths
|"When and where am I looking?"

|*Language*
|Descriptions, translations, dialects
|"What language do I want?"

|*Logic*
|Classification, reasoning
|"Stated or inferred relationships?"

|*Navigation*
|Hierarchies, sorting
|"How do I browse?"

|*Edit*
|Authoring, attribution
|"Who am I and where does my work go?"
|===

Think of coordinates as **viewing filters** that determine what content you see and how it's displayed.

*Active*:: Current, usable content +
*Author*:: Person or system who created/modified content +
*Inferred*:: Relationships computed by classifier +
*Module*:: Organizational grouping of content +
*Path*:: Development branch (Development, Staging, Production) +
*STAMP*:: Status, Time, Author, Module, Path +
*Stated*:: Relationships explicitly authored +
*Version*:: Specific state of content at a point in time

/**
 * Interface for resize handle components that encapsulates their visual appearance and behavior.
 * <p>
 * Resize handles provide the user interface elements that allow users to resize windows
 * or panels by dragging from different positions (corners and edges). This interface
 * defines the contract that all resize handle implementations must fulfill, regardless
 * of their visual representation or specific behavior.
 * <p>
 * Typical implementations include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code CornerResizeHandle} - For corners (NW, NE, SE, SW), usually represented as circles</li>
 *   <li>{@code EdgeResizeHandle} - For edges (N, E, S, W), usually represented as lines</li>
 * </ul>

 * @see AbstractResizeHandle
 * @see CornerResizeHandle
 * @see EdgeResizeHandle

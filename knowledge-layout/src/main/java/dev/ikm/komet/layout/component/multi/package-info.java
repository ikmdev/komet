/**
 * The `dev.ikm.komet.layout.component.multi` package focuses on managing and organizing
 * multi-component layouts (Multiple Concept, Semantics, Pattern, and Stamp KlWidgets) within
 * the Komet framework. These components enable the
 * representation and interaction of multiple related elements or views in a unified
 * and cohesive manner.
 *
 * <p>
 * Key functionalities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Providing tools and abstractions for designing layouts with multiple components.</li>
 *   <li>Supporting the interaction and synchronization of multiple elements within a shared
 *       layout context.</li>
 *   <li>Enabling customization and configuration of multi-component views to suit domain-specific
 *       requirements.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is particularly useful for developers building complex user interfaces that require
 * a high degree of interactivity and flexibility, where multiple components must be displayed
 * and managed simultaneously.
 * </p>

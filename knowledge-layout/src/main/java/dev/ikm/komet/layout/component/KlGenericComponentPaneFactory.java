/**
 * An interface representing a factory for creating instances of {@link KlGenericComponentPane}
 * associated with a specific type of {@link ObservableEntity}. This factory extends
 * {@link KlComponentPaneFactory} and specializes in creating generic component panes
 * for observable entities.
 *
 * The {@code KlGenericComponentPaneFactory} enables the creation and initialization
 * of component panes that interact with observable entities, offering a flexible and
 * reusable mechanism for managing and presenting entity-based components within the Komet framework.
 *
 * Key functionalities include:
 * - Creating instances of {@link KlGenericComponentPane}.
 * - Associating the created component pane with specified {@link ObservableEntity} objects.
 * - Supporting initialization using a {@code KlPreferencesFactory} to customize pane behavior.
 *
 * This factory provides a generic and extensible approach to component pane creation,
 * fitting various layout and interaction requirements in the Komet UI.

/**
 * This package, `dev.ikm.komet.layout.component.version`, is responsible for managing
 * and organizing the layout of entity version KlWidgets within the Komet Knowledge Layout framework.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - The primary focus of this package is to provide service contracts for KlWidgets that present
 *   entity versions for use in UI layout components.
 * - It enables developers to work with components whose states evolve over time,
 *   ensuring that versioning is handled in a structured and consistent manner.
 *
 * Key Responsibilities:
 * - Encapsulating logic for managing versioned states of components and their relationships.
 * - Facilitating the display, organization, and navigation of versioned data in a UI context.
 * - Providing utilities or abstractions for interacting with versioned elements in a
 *   layout or model-driven workflow.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - Supporting the creation and management of layouts that involve version-sensitive
 *   components.
 * - Ensuring version tracking and presentation are seamlessly integrated into UI workflows.
 * - Allowing users or systems to interact with historical, current, or future states of
 *   layout components.
 *
 * Integration Notes:
 * - This package is part of the larger Komet framework and is designed to work with
 *   related layout and UI components.
 * - It plays a critical role in interfacing with other versioning-related modules or
 *   services to ensure consistency and cohesion across the application.
 *
 * Design Goals:
 * - To provide a modular, reusable set of tools for managing versioned components.
 * - To simplify the process of integrating version tracking and navigation into layouts.
 * - To ensure the maintainability and scalability of versioned UI components in
 *   diverse use cases.

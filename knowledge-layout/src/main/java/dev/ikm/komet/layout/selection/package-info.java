/**
 * The {@code selectedAttribute} package provides the necessary classes and interfaces for handling selectedAttribute mechanisms within the layout module.
 *
 * <p>This package contains components that allow users to select various elements within a graphical layout, manage these selections,
 * and perform actions based on the active selections. The core responsibilities of this package include:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Providing classes and interfaces for representing multi-select of
 *     components, versions, attributes, and fields. </li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Definition:
 *
 * Data Element: A data element is the smallest unit of data that can carry a distinct,
 * individual piece of information. It is a general term that can apply to variables, fields,
 * array elements, and collection items.
 *
 * Attribute: Attributes describe the meaning and purpose of a pattern or a field defined by the pattern.
 *
 * Field: Fields represent the data of a specific semantic as specified by the semantics pattern.
 *
 * Properties:
 *
 * A property provides a controlled way to access the data elements of a class. It includes accessors and mutators.
 * They encapsulate methods to read and write the underlying field, and are used to reinforce encapsulation by
 * allowing controlled access to the underlying fields, often including validation or additional processing in
 * the get or set methods.
 *
 *
 * <p>This package is essential for any part of the application dealing with user selections within a layout,
 * providing both the flexibility to define custom selectedAttribute behavior and the convenience of standard implementations.</p>

/**
 * The {@code KlPatternVersionPaneFactory} interface is a factory for creating instances of
 * {@link KlPatternVersionArea} that are linked to {@link ObservablePatternVersion}.
 * <p>
 * It extends {@link KlVersionAreaFactory}, specializing it for working with
 * pattern-related observable versions and their corresponding pane representations.
 * <p>
 * Purpose:
 * - Simplifies the creation and management of UI panes that display specific versions
 *   of patterns tied to observable pattern version data.
 * - Ensures consistency and adherence to version management principles
 *   when working with patterns in the UI.
 * <p>
 * Type Parameters:
 * - {@code T} - The type of {@link KlPatternVersionArea} that this factory will create.
 * - {@code OV} - The type of {@link ObservablePatternVersion} that the pane will be associated with.
 * <p>
 * Responsibilities:
 * - Delegates the creation of {@code KlPatternVersionPane} instances to corresponding methods
 *   defined in {@link KlVersionAreaFactory}.
 * - Facilitates the integration of pattern-specific versions into views that require dynamic
 *   handling of versioned entities.
 * <p>
 * Expected Implementations:
 * - Any concrete implementation of this interface must manage the creation and initialization
 *   of {@link KlPatternVersionArea} instances, ensuring they are correctly associated
 *   with instances of {@link ObservablePatternVersion}.
 * <p>
 * Use Cases:
 * - Working with UI layouts that require dynamic linking and interaction between
 *   observable pattern versions and their pane representations.
 * <p>
 * See Also:
 * - {@link KlVersionAreaFactory}
 * - {@link KlPatternVersionArea}
 * - {@link ObservablePatternVersion}

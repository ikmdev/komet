/**
 * The {@code KlGenericVersionPane} interface defines a pane that is designed to
 * display and manage a generic version of an entity within the Komet Knowledge
 * Layout framework.
 *
 * This interface is a specialization of {@code KlVersionPane}, parameterized with
 * {@code ObservableVersion}, to provide specific functionality for working with
 * general entity versions across various UI components.
 *
 * Purpose:
 * - To offer a reusable contract for handling generic versions of entities in
 *   version-aware UI layouts.
 * - To ensure consistency in version representation and interaction within a
 *   broader layout or system framework.
 *
 * Primary Usage:
 * - This interface serves as a base to integrate generic version-handling capabilities
 *   into panes, enabling developers to implement layouts that can display and interact
 *   with multiple types of versioned data dynamically.
 *
 * Design Notes:
 * - The {@code KlGenericVersionPane} reflects a flexible design capable of working
 *   with various versioned entities by leveraging the {@code ObservableVersion} abstraction.
 * - It inherits default methods for accessing the version data and version properties
 *   from {@code KlVersionPane}.
 *
 * Key Interfaces and Classes:
 * - Extends {@code KlVersionPane} with {@code ObservableVersion} as the type parameter.
 * - Works with the {@code ObservableVersion} class to manage and observe changes in
 *   entity versions dynamically.

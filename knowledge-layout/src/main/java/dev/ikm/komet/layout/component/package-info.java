/**
 * TODO: Consider renaming this package to "container", or moving inside the container package
 * and naming it entity...
 * The `dev.ikm.komet.layout.component` package focuses on defining and managing
 * KlWidgets that present components (Concepts, Patterns, Semantics, and Stamps)
 * within the Komet framework. These components are responsible
 * for structuring and presenting data in a modular and visually organized manner,
 * tailored to the needs of the application and its users.
 *
 * <p>
 * Key functionalities include:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Providing base abstractions and utilities for creating reusable and
 *       customizable layout components.</li>
 *   <li>Supporting component-based organization of data while ensuring flexibility
 *       in layout design and data presentation.</li>
 *   <li>Integrating with other parts of the Komet UI system for seamless user experiences.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This package is designed to be used by developers implementing UI layouts and
 * workflows, ensuring a consistent and structured approach to constructing
 * interactive user interfaces.
 * </p>

/**
 * Represents a generic component pane within the Komet framework that handles observable entities.
 * This interface serves as a specialized implementation of {@link KlComponentPane} for
 * generic observable components, offering a flexible structure for presenting and managing
 * components in a visually organized manner.
 *
 * The {@code KlGenericComponentPane} interface extends the functionalities provided
 * by {@link KlComponentPane}, enabling interaction with {@link ObservableEntity} objects.
 *
 * Key responsibilities include:
 * - Supporting the retrieval and observation of generic observable components.
 * - Providing a flexible structure for handling various types of components within the Komet UI.
 * - Facilitating layout integration and customization for entities extending {@link ObservableEntity}.
 *
 * This interface is part of the `dev.ikm.komet.layout.component` package, designed to
 * integrate with the Komet framework's modular UI components while ensuring clarity
 * and consistency in managing entity-based components.
